# A note about this project

Originally a quick hack to produce some sort of digital scoreboard for 
use in a children's holiday camp, this application has subsequently received
more and more hacks, but it doesn't appear to have fallen over just yet.

The code is bad, I know this.

One day I'll get around to making a proper version of this...
